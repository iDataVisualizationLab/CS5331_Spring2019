12,"Jason Vermillion(L), Pavlo Vorontsov, Chase Meyer",,"Using data from the network traffic of Kyoto University's honeypots#
For our visualization, we would like to show the connections in the data using networks#  
The main relationships we want to show are different types of attacks (malware, shell code, etc.) that are launched on the different types of services (SMTP, DNS, HTTP, etc.) hosted by the various nodes on the cluster# 
Another possible interesting relationship we could visualize include the types of attacks and types of services attacked with the attacks originating from the same source IP addresses#
 In addition, we could add another dimension to the visualization by adding a time selector allowing the user to visualize the changes in the frequency and type of attacks over a given time period#
Notes: Please come up with a more concrete example (using the data) for Thursday so that we can refine the requirements and I will suggest where we can go in term of visual encodings and implementations (maybe an initial interface of a small subset of the data should be good)#Notes:Link graph together",http://www.takakura.com/Kyoto_data/new_data201704/,,https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScolfaVcFvTM5KLPva0rvJ50eL96AJXLJWPXWWd_-RHA4oONg/viewform?usp=sf_link,p1._Vermillion__Chase__Vorontsov.gif,https://jvermill91.github.io/CS4331-P3/collapsibleTest.html,https://github.com/jvermill91/CS4331-Project3,pavlo.chase.jason.jpg

Corrections require for P3:#
1) There should be a progressing bar when you loading new data (new user name), since it may take a few seconds#
2) The bars charts have different ranges for both x (count) and y (time) axis. This makes comparisons between different users/followers difficult. You should use standard ranges for all charts#

3) The chart does not need to be too long (on y-axis), You can make it more compressed so that you can fit more charts into a single screen instead of scrolling down, Comparisons and overview would be better#

4) A better representation is dot plots, See http://www.myweb.ttu.edu/tnhondan/file/Stacking.pdf#

5) For number of the project per languages, bar charts would be better than the listing.  It should be color-coded as well#

6) This is the idea for P2: for each follower, you request the top 50 followers. The max total of people is 50*50 = 2,500 (but it will be fewer due to duplications). Then you draw the network of 2,500 nodes (this is your GitHub network. Each node can be represented by a sunburst which is a radial variation of your bar chart. https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426",,,https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdq6SRXnDIYhDriFXf3X4DRTfyxV6m2zOeZ3eyNGUsA05r9Ig/viewform?usp=sf_link,no-image.png,,,jordanhudgens.jpg

2) Summarize all current users in a table format#
3) Summarize all current jobs in a table format (ordered)#
4) Create a network of jobs, users, and hosts:  use size, shape, and color encoding#
5) All 1) 2) 3) 4) are updated in real-time (every 10 seconds) or by user request",,,,no-image.png,,,Ghazan.png

Corrections require for P3:#
1) There should be a progressing bar when you loading new data (new user name), since it may take a few seconds#
2) The bars charts have different ranges for both x (count) and y (time) axis. This makes comparisons between different users/followers difficult. You should use standard ranges for all charts#

3) The chart does not need to be too long (on y-axis), You can make it more compressed so that you can fit more charts into a single screen instead of scrolling down, Comparisons and overview would be better#

4) A better representation is dot plots, See http://www.myweb.ttu.edu/tnhondan/file/Stacking.pdf#

5) For number of the project per languages, bar charts would be better than the listing.  It should be color-coded as well#

6) This is the idea for P2: for each follower, you request the top 50 followers. The max total of people is 50*50 = 2,500 (but it will be fewer due to duplications). Then you draw the network of 2,500 nodes (this is your GitHub network. Each node can be represented by a sunburst which is a radial variation of your bar chart. https://bl.ocks.org/kerryrodden/7090426",,,,no-image.png,,,jordanhudgens.jpg
